Repository of inert extensions of the standard model.

Following the conventions of 
1206.4563

Each branch is self containded inert model which can be merged with another model
to creates a richer structures.

*SFTM: Singlet fermion toy model
*SFTM: Singlet fermion toy model
*IFDTM: Inert fermion doublet toy model
*SSSFTM: Singlet scalar singlet fermion toy model
